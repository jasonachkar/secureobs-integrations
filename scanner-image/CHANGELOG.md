# Changelog

## v1.2.2 — 2026-05-09

**Bug fix:** OSV-Scanner driver no longer crashes the pipeline on exit code `2` (partial scan — some lockfiles unresolvable) or when no JSON is produced. Both failure paths now return a graceful skip instead of calling `sys.exit(2)`. Removed unused `sys` import.

## v1.2.1 — 2026-05-09

**Bug fix:** Pin `eslint-plugin-security` to `1.7.1` (was `2.1.1`). v2.x of the plugin uses ESLint 9 flat-config format, which causes a circular-reference `JSON.stringify` crash (exit 2) when loaded by ESLint 8. The scanner was silently skipping ESLint on all runs as a result.

## v1.2.0 — 2026-05-02

Bundled multi-scanner runtime + universal ingest API.

**Requires SecureObs API with `POST /api/findings/bulk-universal` deployed first.**

- Dockerfile now installs **Trivy**, **Bandit**, **Checkov**, **OSV-Scanner**, **Node.js/npm**, plus global **eslint@8 + eslint-plugin-security**.
- Drivers for **`trivy`**, **`bandit`**, **`checkov`**, **`osv-scanner`**, and **`eslint-security`** POST rows to **`/api/findings/bulk-universal`** (`UniversalFindingDto` shape).
- **`codeql`**, **`sonarqube`**, **`snyk`**, **`owasp-zap`** remain **intentionally skipped** inside this image — they expect vendor CI, tokens, SARIF, or hosted DAST rather than a generic tarball scan. Logs are **`INFO`** (not alarming): "not bundled … use vendor integration".
- **Semgrep** / **GitLeaks** unchanged — still hit their typed bulk endpoints (`/api/findings/bulk-semgrep`, `/api/findings/bulk-gitleaks`).

## v1.1.0 — 2026-05-02

Dynamic scanner selection.

- The `scan` subcommand now calls `GET /api/projects/{projectId}/scanners/active` at the start of every run and executes only the scanners the user has enabled in the SecureObs dashboard. Pipeline YAML stays identical for every project — adding or removing a scanner from the dashboard takes effect on the next CI run with **zero pipeline edits**.
- Driver registry maps catalog keys to runners. (As of **v1.2.0** most catalog keys execute real scanners; **`codeql` / `sonarqube` / `snyk` / `owasp-zap`** still log an informational skip — see below.)
- Defensive fallback: if the active-scanners endpoint is unreachable (network / 5xx), the orchestrator falls back to the default set (`semgrep`, `gitleaks`) so a degraded control plane never breaks a user's pipeline. Auth failures and unknown projects still abort hard with exit code 1.
- Scanner runner signature extended with an optional `config` argument (per-project tuning surfaced from `ProjectScanner.Config`).
- Catalog-vs-image skew: unknown keys from the API are skipped with a warning; older APIs without `bulk-universal` require upgrading the backend before **`trivy` / `bandit` / …** findings persist.

## v1.0.0 — 2026-04-27

Initial release.

- Bundled Docker image with Semgrep (p/ci ruleset) and GitLeaks v8.21.2
- `scan` subcommand: runs both scanners against `/workspace`, posts findings to SecureObs API
- `gate` subcommand: queries API for blocking findings, exits 3 if blocked
- `pr-comment` subcommand: posts or updates a single PR comment with scan status (Azure DevOps and GitHub Actions)
- Marker-based comment deduplication — one comment per PR, updated on each run
- Structured logging to stderr; `SECUREOBS_DEBUG=1` enables verbose output
- Retry logic on transient API errors (3 attempts, exponential backoff)
